        <h4>What Is an Internet Service Provider (ISP)?</h4>
        <p>
            he term Internet service provider (ISP) refers to a company that provides
             access to the Internet to both personal and business customers.
              ISPs make it possible for their customers to surf the web, shop online,
               conduct business, and connect with family and friends—all for a fee.
                ISPs may also provide other services including email services,
                 domain registration, web hosting, and browser packages.
                  An ISP may also be referred to as an information service provider,
                   a storage service provider, an Internet service provider (INSP)
                   , or any combination of these three based on the services the 
                   company offers.

            <li>ISPs may also provide other services such as email services, domain registration, web hosting, and browser services.</li>
            <li>An ISP is considered to be an information service provider, storage service provider, Internet network service provider (INSP), or a mix of all of them.</li>
            <li>Internet use has evolved from only those with university or government accounts having access to nearly everyone having access, whether it's paid or free.</li>
            <li>Access has gone from dial-up connections to high-speed broadband technology.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Understanding Internet Service Provider (ISP)
Internet service was originally limited to government agencies and specific university departments. The technology was developed to provide access to the general public through the World Wide Web in the late 1980s. Initially, consumers were able to gain limited access through a few ISPs—America Online (AOL) being one of the most recognized names at the time—that used dial-up connections using a phone line.
        </p>
        <p>
            The number of ISPs increased to several thousand during the mid-1990s and the boom was on. As the options for connectivity increased and speeds moved away from slower dial-up connections, the Internet economy was born. Providers developed more advanced technology, allowing customers high-speed access via broadband technology through cable and digital subscriber line (DSL) modems.


Behind all of this was a multi-layered web of connections. Local ISPs sold access to customers but paid larger ISPs for their own access. These larger ISPs, in turn, paid even larger ISPs for access. The trail leads to Tier 1 carriers that can reach every network access point without having to pay for access. These Tier 1 companies own the infrastructure in their region.

            Examples of Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
Many of the largest ISPs are also large telecommunications companies that provide a wide array of services. For example, in addition to data and broadband Internet services, AT&T (T) provides local and long-distance telephone services, managed networking, telecommunications equipment, and feature film, television, and gaming production and distribution.

Verizon Communications (VZ) is another ISP that has a diversified range of services. The conglomerate offers local and long-distance voice, as well as broadband video, data center and cloud services, and security and managed network services.

To help low-income families and seniors handle the cost, some ISPs offer special programs. The government also opened an Emergency Broadband Benefit (EBB) program on May 12, 2021, to provide help to families to get these services.
